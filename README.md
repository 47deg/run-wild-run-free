# Functional Programming Patterns v3 #
(For the pragmatic programmer)

In this talk we will see a pragmatic approach to building a purely functional architecture that delivers cohesive functional components. 
We will cover functional patterns such as Free Monads, Free Applicatives, Coproducts, Implicits, Kleisli arrows, dependently typed checked exceptions 
and types as well as how they can be glued together to achieve pure functions that are free of Interpretation, composable and fault tolerant
